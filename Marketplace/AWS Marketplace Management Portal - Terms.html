    <h2>Terms and Conditions for AWS Marketplace Sellers</h2>
    <div class="row spacing-top-medium">
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>
            <p id="contract_header_present">These Terms and Conditions for AWS Marketplace Sellers (this &quot;Agreement&quot;) govern your listing or offer of software, products or content in AWS Marketplace and are an agreement between Amazon Web Services, Inc. (&quot;AWS,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) and you or the entity you represent (&quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;). This Agreement takes effect when you accept these terms as set forth in Section 9.12 below or, if earlier, when you use any of the Service Offerings (the &quot;Effective Date&quot;). You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity. Please see Section 9 for definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>1. Eligibility.</strong> You must meet the following eligibility requirements in order to offer Your Marketplace Content through the AWS Marketplace. You must: (a) to the extent you have a Paid Listing, be a permanent U.S. or European Union (EU) resident or citizen or a business entity organized or incorporated in the United States or a member state of the EU and have a verified U.S. bank account and (where applicable) a valid VAT registration; (b) have a valid Amazon Web Services customer account; and (c) meet any other eligibility requirements specified in the AWS Marketplace Listing Guidelines on the AWS Site.</p>

<p><strong>2. Verification.</strong> We may require you to provide additional registration information to verify your identity. This information may include your social security number or employer identification number (EIN), a valid U.S. credit card, a verified U.S. bank account, your VAT number (where applicable) or other financial, business, tax or personal information. We may make, directly or through third parties, any inquiries we consider necessary to validate information that you provide to us, including checking commercial databases. You authorize us to obtain one or more of your credit reports to establish, update, or renew your account with us or in the event of a dispute relating to this Agreement and activity under your account. By submitting your personal information you agree that it will be subject to the AWS Privacy Policy currently referenced at <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/privacy">http://aws.amazon.com/privacy</a>, as it may be updated by us from time to time.</p>

<p><strong>3. Listings.</strong> You may list Your Marketplace Content in the AWS Marketplace subject to the following terms:</p>

<p><strong>3.1 Review of Listings.</strong> You must submit Your Marketplace Content to us for review as described in the AWS Marketplace Listing Guidelines, and we may accept or reject it for any reason. You are responsible for evaluating and testing Your Marketplace Content before submitting it to AWS to confirm that it complies with this Agreement and our Policies and operates properly with the web services offered by AWS. We may review and test Your Marketplace Content submitted for listing in the AWS Marketplace at any time, including for security-related concerns and to check the accuracy of descriptions and other materials included in Your Marketplace Content. You will cooperate with our review and testing.</p>

<p><strong>3.2 Responsibility for Your Marketplace Content.</strong> You are responsible for Your Marketplace Content. Subject to Section 3.5 of this Agreement, you will establish the pricing, license rights and other terms governing subscribers&rsquo; use of Your Marketplace Content. The terms governing use of Your Marketplace Content by subscribers must be consistent with our terms for use of any web services offered by AWS that are used with Your Marketplace Content, and our terms will control to the extent of any conflict. If you do not specify license rights for Your Marketplace Content, you agree to license Your Marketplace Content to subscribers on the same terms that we license software offered by AWS to subscribers. You will ensure that all information about Your Marketplace Content (including information about applicable fees) displayed on the AWS Site is, at all times, accurate, complete, not misleading, and in compliance with applicable law. Except as provided in this Agreement, AWS obtains no rights under this Agreement from you to Your Marketplace Content.</p>

<p><strong>3.3 Maintenance and Removal of Your Marketplace Content.</strong> You will ensure that all software contained in Your Marketplace Content is kept up-to-date with current bug fixes and patches. If AWS determines that an update to the operating system utilized in Your Marketplace Content offered as an AMI is necessary or desirable, it may, but is not obligated to, contact you to request that you update Your Marketplace Content and resubmit Your Marketplace Content in accordance with Section 3.1. If you fail to update Your Marketplace Content offered as an AMI within the time period specified in such notice, then AWS reserves the right to immediately remove Your Marketplace Content from the AWS Marketplace. You may remove a listing of or offer for Your Marketplace Content from the AWS Marketplace at any time in accordance with the AWS Marketplace Listing Guidelines. We may also remove any listing or offer for Your Marketplace Content from the AWS Marketplace at any time for any reason. Any removal by you or us of any listing or offer of Your Marketplace Content from the AWS Marketplace will apply to prospective subscribers only and you will continue to enable current subscribers to use Your Marketplace Content after removal of the listing or offer until that subscriber terminates their use.</p>

<p><strong>3.4 Our Role.</strong> You will be the seller of record for Your Marketplace Content. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, we are not involved in any underlying transaction between you and any subscriber. We are not responsible for any dispute between you and any subscriber, but we may elect to assist in the resolution of any dispute between you and any subscriber. If we elect to assist in the resolution of a dispute, you agree to cooperate with us to resolve the dispute.</p>

<p><strong>3.5 Fair Treatment of Our Subscribers.</strong> Your Marketplace Content must be offered to AWS subscribers on terms and conditions (including but not limited to price) at least as favorable to the same offering(s) on Similar Sales Channels. For example, (a) your total fees and charges for Your Marketplace Content must not exceed the lowest total fees and charges you offer through any Similar Sales Channels and (b) you must make available in the AWS Marketplace all software (including all versions) that you make available through any Similar Sales Channel. You will provide all updates and new versions of Your Marketplace Content as soon as those updates or versions are made available through a Similar Sales Channel.</p>

<p><strong>3.6 Subscriber Ratings and Feedback.</strong> We may implement mechanisms that rate, or allow subscribers to rate and provide feedback about, Your Marketplace Content (including information about Your Marketplace Content that has been removed from the AWS Marketplace), you, and your performance in connection with Your Marketplace Content and the AWS Marketplace. We may make these ratings and feedback publicly available.</p>

<p><strong>3.7 Technical Support and Subscriber Service.</strong> You are solely responsible for technical support (if any) for Your Marketplace Content. We have no obligation to provide subscriber support or technical support to any subscriber of Your Marketplace Content.</p>

<p><strong>3.8 Subscriber Information. </strong>Except as expressly permitted by us, you may use Subscriber Information only to communicate with subscribers who acquire rights in Your Marketplace Content (i) to provide customer training and technical support and (ii) for software activation, configuration and customization of content delivered via a software-as-a-service model. You may not use Subscriber Information for any other purpose. For example, you may not, directly or indirectly: (a) disclose any Subscriber Information to any third party, except as necessary for you to perform your obligations under this Agreement and only if you ensure that every recipient uses the information only for that purpose and complies with any restrictions applicable to you; (b) use any Subscriber Information for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever; (c) use any Subscriber Information in any way inconsistent with applicable privacy policies or law; (d) contact a subscriber to influence them to make an alternative purchase; (e) disparage us, our affiliates or any of their or our respective products; or (f) target communications of any kind on the basis of the intended recipient being an AWS Marketplace subscriber. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may use Subscriber Information for your marketing or promotional purposes in accordance with applicable privacy policies and law provided that you have obtained the express consent of subscribers receiving such marketing or promotional communications. This section does not prevent you from using other information that you acquire without reference to Subscriber Information for any purpose, even if that information is identical to Subscriber Information, as long as you do not target communications on the basis of the intended recipient being an AWS Marketplace customer.</p>

<p><strong>3.9 Marketing Restriction. </strong>You may not include in Your Marketplace Content, any advertisements or promotions for, or opportunities for a subscriber to purchase, products that you do not list in the AWS Marketplace. If you choose to market or make other references to the availability of Your Marketplace Content, you must include a reference to the AWS Marketplace or use an approved logo provided by us, in compliance with any trademark usage guidelines we specify.</p>

<p><strong>3.10 Other Rights. </strong>During the term of this Agreement and for so long as subscribers are permitted to use Your Marketplace Content, you grant us a nonexclusive, worldwide license to: (a) reproduce, distribute, display, transmit, promote, and otherwise digitally make available (via all means of online and electronic distribution), Your Marketplace Content offered as an AMI through the AWS Marketplace; (b) use (i) your trademarks and logos in the form you provide them to us (with any modifications to optimize their viewing), and (ii) limited portions of Your Marketplace Content (e.g. product description) in connection with marketing Your Marketplace Content or the AWS Marketplace and (c) access, display, promote and otherwise use Your Marketplace Content offered as an AMI solely in connection with demonstrating Your Marketplace Content for potential subscribers. Use of or access to Your Marketplace Content by AWS for the purposes specified in this section shall be pursuant to the foregoing license and the terms of this Agreement, and such license expressly supersedes any click-through, browse wrap and/or other terms related to Your Marketplace Content. We may permit our affiliates and independent contractors to exercise the rights that you grant to us in this Agreement. We assume all liability and responsibility for our affiliates&rsquo; and independent contractors&rsquo; compliance with, or breach of, the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>4. Reselling on AWS Marketplace.</strong> We may facilitate certain transactions for the resale of Your Marketplace Content by and between sellers on AWS Marketplace subject to the following and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement:</p>

<p><strong>4.1 Eligibility.</strong> As agreed by you and another seller on AWS Marketplace, you may (i) designate such other person or entity as a reseller of one or more products for which you have a Paid Listing on AWS Marketplace (in such case, you are an <strong>&ldquo;ISV&rdquo;</strong>), or (ii) accept a designation as a reseller of such other person or entity&rsquo;s product(s) on AWS Marketplace (in such case, you are an <strong>&ldquo;Authorized Reseller&rdquo;</strong>) in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. To be eligible to use this AWS Marketplace feature, Authorized Reseller and ISV each must be an AWS customer and each must have accepted the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>4.2 Authorized Resale Products.</strong> ISV must have a Paid Listing for each product that it authorizes for resale using this AWS Marketplace feature (each an <strong>&ldquo;Authorized Resale Product&rdquo;</strong>). ISV&rsquo;s Paid Listing fulfills the requirement under Section 1 of this Agreement for Authorized Reseller&rsquo;s eligibility to offer Authorized Resale Products through the AWS Marketplace. If ISV has submitted the Authorized Resale Product to us and we have approved it for listing as set forth in Section 3.1, Authorized Reseller is not required to submit the same Authorized Resale Product to us for review and approval.</p>

<p><strong>4.3 Establishing Resellers.</strong> In order to designate or accept a designation as an Authorized Reseller, ISV and Authorized Reseller must complete and agree to an AWS Marketplace Reseller Authorization that identifies the specific Authorized Resale Products and the price that Authorized Reseller will pay to ISV for the Authorized Resale Products consistent with the functionality available in AWS Marketplace. By designating an Authorized Reseller, ISV agrees to sell to Authorized Reseller the specified Authorized Resale Products for resale only and authorizes Authorized Reseller to issue offers for, and resell via offers, the same Authorized Resale Products to AWS subscribers in AWS Marketplace. By accepting a designation as an Authorized Reseller, Authorized Reseller agrees to purchase the specified products from ISV at the designated price set forth in the AWS Marketplace Reseller Authorization solely for resale to AWS subscribers and to conduct such resales using offers in AWS Marketplace. By accepting a designation as an Authorized Reseller, Authorized Reseller agrees to purchase the specified Authorized Resale Products from ISV solely for resale to AWS subscribers and to conduct such resales using offers in AWS Marketplace. In addition, ISV and Authorized Reseller may, as agreed by them, specify special pricing that Authorized Reseller will pay to ISV for a custom resale transaction pursuant to which Authorized Reseller will issue an offer for, and resell via such offer, the specified product(s) to a designated AWS subscriber by completing and agreeing to a Custom Resale Transaction Request.</p>

<p><strong>4.4 Resale Transactions.</strong> Each resale by Authorized Reseller of an Authorized Resale Product to a subscriber includes a contemporaneous sale of the same Authorized Resale Product from ISV to Authorized Reseller. Each such sale and resale is a Transaction as defined in Section 9. If you are an ISV, in each sale of Authorized Resale Products from ISV to Reseller: all references in this Agreement to &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; mean ISV; the Authorized Resale Product(s) are Your Marketplace Content; ISV is the seller of record, and the subscriber is Authorized Reseller. If you are a Reseller, in each resale of Authorized Resale Products to a subscriber: all references in this Agreement to &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; mean Authorized Reseller; the Authorized Resale Product(s) are Your Marketplace Content; and Authorized Reseller is the seller of record, and the subscriber is person or entity that may launch and use the Authorized Resale Product from the AWS Marketplace.</p>

<p><strong>4.5 Price Modifications.</strong> To the extent that ISV&rsquo;s price to Authorized Reseller for an Authorized Resale Product is based on the publicly available price of the corresponding Paid Listing, ISV and Authorized Reseller acknowledge and agree that if ISV modifies the publicly available price for the corresponding Paid Listing, such modification will also modify the price Authorized Reseller pays to ISV for sale of such Authorized Resale Product under the applicable AWS Marketplace Reseller Authorization. Modification of the publicly available price by ISV will not modify the pricing payable by Authorized Reseller for Authorized Resale Products (i) already purchased by Authorized Reseller, or (ii) purchased by Authorized Reseller contemporaneously with resale of such Authorized Resale Products if the applicable resale offer was issued by Authorized Reseller prior to ISV&rsquo;s price modification.</p>

<p><strong>4.6 Use of Data.</strong> Unless otherwise agreed by the applicable subscriber, as between Authorized Reseller and ISV, subscribers are purchasing Authorized Resale Products only from Authorized Reseller and such resales by Authorized Reseller do not create a subscriber relationship with ISV. Authorized Reseller will not, except as expressly permitted under Section 3.8, disclose to ISV any Subscriber Information arising from Authorized Reseller&rsquo;s resales of Authorized Resale Products to users or allow ISV to use any such Subscriber Information. ISV and Authorized Reseller each represent, warrant and covenant that any data or information that it transmits or provides to us or to the other, including any such data or information that we convey to ISV or Authorized Reseller for the other in connection with this AWS Marketplace feature or any Transactions contemplated by this Section 4, whether proposed or actual, has been collected, stored, processed, disclosed and used consistent, in all ways, with applicable privacy policies and law, and that the receipt, storage, use, processing, disclosure or transmission of such data by us or others in connection with this AWS Marketplace feature and the Transactions contemplated by the this Section 4does not require and is not contingent upon the need to obtain any additional consents, authorization, or other rights or permissions from any other person or entity.</p>

<p><strong>4.7 Termination of Reseller Authorization.</strong> Either ISV or Authorized Reseller (the <strong>&ldquo;Terminating Party&rdquo;</strong>) may notify us at any time that it wishes to terminate an applicable AWS Marketplace Reseller Authorization. The Terminating Party represents and warrants that its termination of any AWS Marketplace Reseller Authorization is and will be in accordance with the terms and conditions of its agreement with Authorized Reseller or ISV, as applicable.</p>

<p><strong>4.8 Implementation of Termination.</strong> Upon receipt of a termination notice pursuant to Section 4.7 or upon any termination of this Agreement by ISV or Authorized Reseller, we will implement such termination within a reasonable period by (i) removing (a) Authorized Reseller&rsquo;s ability to purchase Authorized Resale Products from ISV pursuant to the applicable AWS Marketplace Reseller Authorization and any Custom Resale Transaction Request, and (b) Authorized Reseller&rsquo;s ability to issue offers for the same for resale to AWS subscribers, and (ii) removing any offers for Authorized Resale Products issued by Authorized Reseller that have not yet been consummated. Once termination is implemented, we will not facilitate any further Transactions as described in the applicable AWS Marketplace Reseller Authorization or any Custom Resale Transaction Request (ongoing subscriptions obtained through earlier Transactions will not be affected). However, ISV and Authorized Reseller acknowledge and agree we may continue to facilitate Transactions under applicable AWS Marketplace Reseller Authorization(s) and Custom Resale Transaction Request(s) until implantation of termination is complete, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such Transactions.</p>

<p><strong>4.9 No Interference.</strong> Neither ISV nor Authorized Reseller will interfere with or prejudice the other&rsquo;s performance of its obligations under this Agreement, whether following termination of any AWS Marketplace Reseller Authorization or otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>5. Additional Terms for Paid Listings.</strong> If Your Marketplace Content is listed as a Paid Listing, the terms in this Section 4 also apply. All non-Paid Listings of Your Marketplace Content (e.g. bring your own license) must have a corresponding Paid Listing in the AWS Marketplace no later than 90 days after the initial listing of the non-Paid Listing version, unless we determine that we cannot accept Paid Listings from you for regulatory reasons. Any license governing software that is made available via a non-Paid Listing (regardless of the channel used to sell such license) must allow the licensee to use the software on AWS without additional fees (including additional support fees), costs, requirements, or restrictions.</p>

<p><strong>5.1 Processing of Transactions; Collection of Transaction Proceeds.</strong>You hereby appoint us as your payment processing agent for the limited purpose of receiving payments on your behalf from users that authorize payments to you directly or to third-party services that enable transactions with you. On your behalf, we will process all payments and refunds for Transactions and collect the applicable Transaction Proceeds. Receipt of funds from users by us on your behalf in connection with Your Marketplace Content shall be deemed receipt of funds from users by you and will satisfy the obligations owed to you by users in the amount of the applicable payment by the user. We do not guarantee payment on behalf of any subscribers, including payments owed to ISV from Authorized Resellers. Except where you have enabled subscribers to use an existing license to cover use of Your Marketplace Content and with regard to any Shortfall, you will ensure that all fees and charges payable by subscribers for Your Marketplace Content are billed and collected through us and you will not offer or establish any alternative means of payment. We may impose transaction limits on some or all subscribers and sellers relating to the value of any Transaction or disbursement, the cumulative value of all Transactions or disbursements during a period of time or the number of Transactions per day or other period of time. We may withhold for investigation, or refuse to process, any of your Transactions that we suspect is fraudulent, unlawful or otherwise violates the terms of this Agreement or our Policies.</p>

<p><strong>5.2 Remittance of Transaction Proceeds to You.</strong> At the end of each month, we will pay to you all previously unpaid Transaction Proceeds that we have collected as of the date that is 2 business days prior to the date of payment, except that we may withhold our first payment to you until the end of the third full month after your initial listing of any of Your Marketplace Content, and provided that Transaction Proceeds from the resale of Authorized Resale Products will be subject to Section 5.3. We will deduct from each payment any Listing Fees, ISV Listing Fees and Reseller Processing Fees due to us related to Your Marketplace Content and the associated Transaction(s). We may also withhold, deduct, or setoff any amounts payable by you to us or our affiliates against any Transaction Proceeds. No Transaction Proceeds will be payable to you in connection with our use of Your Marketplace Content for the purposes described in Section 3.10. All payments to you will be sent through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system to your designated U.S. bank account. If there is an error in the processing of any Transaction, you authorize us to initiate debit or credit entries to your designated bank account, to correct such error, provided that any such correction is made in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If we are unable to debit your designated bank account for any reason, you authorize us to resubmit the debit, plus any applicable fees, to any other bank account or payment instrument that you have on file with us or to deduct the debit and applicable fees from future Transaction Proceeds.</p>

<p><strong>5.3 Resale Transaction Proceeds.</strong> Amounts payable to ISVs from Authorized Resellers for the sale of Authorized Resale Products will be disbursed from Transaction Proceeds that we collect from the contemporaneous resale of such Authorized Resale Products by Authorized Resellers. We do not separately collect payment from Authorized Resellers of the price payable to ISVs for sales of Authorized Resale Products. Transaction Proceeds from each resale of an Authorized Resale Product will be disbursed by us in the following order: (i) we will deduct the Reseller Processing Fee and the ISV Listing Fee for the contemporaneous sale from ISV to Authorized Reseller, (ii) we will disburse remaining Transaction Proceeds to ISV up to the price for the Authorized Resale Product payable by the Authorized Reseller as set forth in the applicable AWS Marketplace Reseller Authorization or, if applicable, the Custom Resale Transaction Request, and (iii) we will disburse any remaining Transaction Proceeds to Authorized Reseller. We do not guarantee payment to ISV on behalf of Authorized Reseller. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, ISV will bear the sole risk of payment in full from Authorized Reseller. If following payment from us to ISV of Transaction Proceeds as set forth above, there is any Shortfall, such Shortfall is solely Authorized Reseller&rsquo;s debt. We have no obligation or liability with respect to any such Shortfall or Authorized Reseller debt.</p>

<p><strong>5.4 Taxes.</strong> You are responsible for the calculation, invoicing (if required), validation and payment of any and all sales, use, excise, import, export, value-added, withholding and other taxes and duties assessed, incurred or required to be collected (<strong>&ldquo;Taxes&rdquo;</strong>) or paid for any reason in connection with any Transaction and with Your Marketplace Content. We are not obliged to determine whether any Taxes apply to any Transaction, and we are not responsible for remitting Taxes to any taxing authority with respect to any Transaction, or for reporting any information (including the payment of Taxes) with respect to any Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when we are legally obligated by a valid taxing authority, we will collect Taxes, and we will provide subscribers with a compliant tax invoice.</p>

<p><strong>5.5 Risk of Loss.</strong> We will bear the risk of fraud associated with our sale or license of the web services offered by AWS. You will bear all other risk of fraud or loss, including the risk of chargebacks or credit card fraud associated with your sale or license of Your Marketplace Content. If we receive a chargeback or determine a payment related to a Transaction was a result of fraud, then you will promptly reimburse us for the total amount of any applicable Transaction Proceeds previously paid to you, as well as all credit card association, bank or other payment processing, re-presentment and/or penalty fees associated with the original Transaction.</p>

<p><strong>5.6 Cancellations and Refunds.</strong> Except where not required by the AWS Marketplace Listing Guidelines, you will post your cancellation and refund policy in the listing or offer for Your Marketplace Content in the AWS Marketplace. At a minimum, this cancellation and refund policy must: (a) allow subscribers who subscribe to Your Marketplace Content through a Transaction to cancel on-going subscriptions for Your Marketplace Content through the AWS Site; and (b) comply with the other requirements of this Agreement, including the AWS Marketplace Listing Guidelines. You will accept and process cancellations of, and provide refunds and adjustments for, Your Marketplace Content in accordance with the cancellation and refund policy posted at the time of the applicable Transaction. You will route all Transaction refund (and adjustment) payments through us. We will credit the applicable account, and you will reimburse us for all amounts so refunded.</p>

<p><strong>5.7 Removal.</strong> Upon removal of the listing or offer of Your Marketplace Content, you will continue to provide support for Your Marketplace Content to current subscribers for at least 90 days following removal of the listing. If you are an ISV, you will continue to provide support for the Authorized Resale Products to Authorized Reseller until Authorized Reseller&rsquo;s obligations to its current subscribers with respect to such Authorized Resale Products are completed.</p>

<p><strong>6. Term and Termination.</strong> The term of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date set forth on the Cover Page and will continue until terminated. Either party may terminate this Agreement for any or no reason by providing 30 days&rsquo; written notice to the other party. Following termination of this Agreement, you will allow existing subscribers to continue to use Your Marketplace Content on terms and conditions (including price) at least as favorable as those in effect at the time of termination (but in any event consistent with the requirements of Section 3.2), and on your behalf, we will continue to process all payments and refunds for Transactions and collect the applicable Transaction Proceeds in accordance with Section 4; provided, however, that upon no less than 90 days&rsquo; prior notice to existing subscribers, you may stop making Your Marketplace Content available to existing subscribers to the extent that you are no longer making products similar to Your Marketplace Content commercially available on any Similar Sales Channel.
