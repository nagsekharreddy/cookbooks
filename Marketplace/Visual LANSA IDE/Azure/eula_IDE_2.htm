<p>15. Governing Law and Disputes. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, USA without regard to conflicts of law rules or principles. All claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts sitting in Cook County, Illinois, and Licensee consents to personal jurisdiction in those courts. Despite the foregoing, Licensee agrees that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for LANSA in the event of a breach or threatened breach of a provision of this Agreement protecting LANSA&rsquo;s intellectual property or Confidential Information, and that in the event of such a breach or threat, LANSA, in addition to any other remedies to which it is entitled, is entitled to such preliminary or injunctive relief (including an order prohibiting Licensee from taking actions in breach of such provisions), without the need for posting bond, and specific performance as may be appropriate. The parties agree that neither the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, nor the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) shall apply to this Agreement, regardless of the states in which the parties do business or are incorporated.</p>

<p>16. Miscellaneous. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between LANSA and Licensee with respect to its subject matter, superseding all other prior or contemporaneous communications or understandings between the parties (whether written or oral) relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed severable, and the unenforceability of any one or more of its provisions will not affect the enforceability of any other provision. If any provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Licensee may not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any of the rights that it grants, without the prior written consent of LANSA, and any purported assignment in violation of the preceding sentence will be void and will constitute a breach of this Agreement. This Agreement will be binding upon the parties&rsquo; respective successors and permitted assigns. No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right, power or remedy will operate as a waiver of that right, power or remedy, and no waiver will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the waiving party. Any provision of this Agreement that imposes or contemplates continuing obligations on a party will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, including but not limited to the provisions with respect to protection of Confidential Information, limitations of liability, indemnification, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and this paragraph.</p>
